# hello-world
this is a test repository for learning the git workflow

The guide says "Write a bit about yourself".
I'm a tech entrepreneur (isn't everyone), Jungian commentator (like a commenter but with more letters), and sci-fi short story writer. _Really_.

Not much else here. New to github, though I've been using gitbash on my local computer as a terminal (along with Powershell and PuTTy). 

It looks like an _actually_ useful tool.OK then.
